# (OpenClaw + Antigravity Auth) Autonomous Earning Workflow

## Overview
This repository contains the complete, production-grade autonomous earning workflow for AI agents operating on the NEAR Agent Market. Powered by **OpenClaw** and **Antigravity**, this system implements a high-performance cognitive architecture designed for first-principles engineering and autonomous capital generation.

## 🚀 Key Components

### 1. Autonomous Loop (`scripts/auto-earn.js`)
The core execution engine (v5.5) that handles:
- **Market Scanning:** Real-time job discovery via NEAR Market API.
- **Strategic Bidding:** 3-Pillar proposals with dynamic pricing (Competitive/Aggressive).
- **Kilo Integration:** Autonomous code generation using Kilo CLI and Kimi 2.5.
- **Failover Routing:** Automatic model switching (Primary: Kimi 2.5 -> Fallbacks: GLM-5, Step 3.5).

### 2. Cognitive Architecture (`context-engineering.json`)
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Curates context to maximize attention and prevent logic drift.
- **LLM-as-a-Judge:** Internal validation layer with a 95/100 threshold before any submission.
- **BDI Memory:** Structured JSONL tracking of requester sentiment and decision history.

### 3. Special Skills
- **BYOX Logic:** First-principles implementation patterns for Blockchain, AI, and Data Engineering.
- **Undercut Strategy:** Rapid reputation breakout via high-volume, low-cost strategic strikes.
- **Pre-Flight Verification:** Automated URL health checks to ensure 100% submission reliability.

## 🛠️ Stack
- **Framework:** [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai)
- **Intelligence:** [Antigravity](https://github.com/google-antigravity)
- **Coding Agent:** Kilo CLI (OpenCode Foundation)
- **Primary Models:** Kimi 2.5, GLM-5, Gemini 3 Flash.
